### Branches + Explanations 
- master
- master-v3 (Copy of Master branch but with Manifest V3)
- master-free (Copy of Master with only free features)
- master-free-v3 (Copy of Master Free but with Manifest V3)

Merging Manifest V3 reduces debugging capabilities 
  - use the default branch names for development and just merge in the v3 versions for release.
